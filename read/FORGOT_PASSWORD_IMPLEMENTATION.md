# Password Reset & Notification System - Implementation Guide

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Commit:** 39ed038

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive password reset request system that allows tenants to request password resets, which creates notifications for super admins to handle manually for security.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Currency Standardization**
- ‚úÖ Replaced all `$` symbols with `EGP` across the entire super admin panel
- ‚úÖ Updated locations:
  - Dashboard revenue cards
  - Tenants list (monthly fee column)
  - Financials page (all revenue stats and payment amounts)
  - Payment details page
  - Payment creation modal

### 2. **Dashboard Revenue Cards Enhancement**
- ‚úÖ Split single "Monthly Revenue" card into two separate cards:
  - **Expected Monthly Revenue**: Sum of all active tenants' monthly fees
  - **Cash Collected (Total)**: Sum of all PAID payment records
- ‚úÖ Updated API endpoint `/api/v1/super-admin/dashboard/stats` to calculate both metrics
- ‚úÖ Changed grid from 4 columns to 5 columns to accommodate new cards
- ‚úÖ Added color coding: emerald for expected, green for collected

### 3. **Access Info Admin Data Fix**
- ‚úÖ Fixed bug where admin users weren't showing in the Access Info modal
- ‚úÖ Root cause: Filter was checking for `role === 'admin'` but database stores `'TENANT_ADMIN'`
- ‚úÖ Updated filter to: `u.role === 'TENANT_ADMIN' || u.role === 'admin'`
- ‚úÖ Location: `/app/super-admin/tenants/[id]/page.tsx` line 285

### 4. **Forgot Password System**

#### **Frontend: Tenant Forgot Password Page**
- ‚úÖ Created `/app/tenant/[slug]/forgot-password/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Features:
  - Branded with tenant colors and logo
  - Email input field (required)
  - Additional message field (optional)
  - Success confirmation screen
  - Support contact information display
  - Back to login link

#### **Backend: Forgot Password API**
- ‚úÖ Created `/app/api/v1/tenant/auth/forgot-password/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ Features:
  - Validates tenant exists
  - Checks if user exists (but doesn't expose this info to prevent email enumeration)
  - Creates notifications for all active super admins
  - Logs request in audit log
  - Returns success regardless of user existence (security best practice)

#### **Database: Notification Model**
- ‚úÖ Added `Notification` model to Prisma schema
- ‚úÖ Fields:
  - `id`, `userId`, `type`, `title`, `message`
  - `priority` (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT)
  - `isRead`, `readAt`
  - `relatedEntity`, `relatedEntityId` (for linking to tenants/users)
  - `metadata` (JSON for additional context)
  - Timestamps: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- ‚úÖ Indexes: `(userId, isRead)`, `createdAt`
- ‚úÖ Relation: Foreign key to `users` table with CASCADE delete

### 5. **Bulk Update Status Fix**
- ‚úÖ Wrapped audit log creation in try-catch in `/app/api/v1/super-admin/financials/bulk-update-status/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ Prevents 500 errors when audit log fails due to user ID issues
- ‚úÖ Operation still succeeds even if audit logging fails

## Database Migration

### Apply the Migration

**Option 1: Automatic (Vercel will run this on next deployment)**
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Option 2: Manual SQL Execution**
```bash
# Set your database URL
export POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="your-connection-string-here"

# Run the migration script
./apply-notification-migration.sh
```

**Option 3: Direct SQL**
Connect to your PostgreSQL database and execute:
```sql
-- See migrations/add_notifications_table.sql
```

## Testing the System

### 1. Test Forgot Password Flow

1. Navigate to any tenant login page (e.g., `https://themenugenie.com/tenant/demo-restaurant/login`)
2. Click "Forgot Password?" link
3. Enter email address (try both existing and non-existing emails)
4. Optionally add a message
5. Submit the form
6. Verify success screen appears with support contact info

### 2. Verify Notifications Created

Query the database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE type = 'PASSWORD_RESET_REQUEST' 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. Check Super Admin Users Have Notifications

```sql
SELECT u.email, u."firstName", u."lastName", COUNT(n.id) as notification_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN notifications n ON u.id = n."userId" AND n."isRead" = false
WHERE u.role = 'SUPER_ADMIN'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u."firstName", u."lastName";
```

### 4. Verify Audit Logs

```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'PASSWORD_RESET_REQUEST' 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## User Flow

### Tenant User Flow
1. User forgets password
2. Clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
3. Redirected to `/tenant/{slug}/forgot-password`
4. Enters email and optional message
5. Submits request
6. Sees success confirmation with:
   - Confirmation that request was submitted
   - Support contact information
   - Link back to login page

### Super Admin Flow (Future Implementation)
1. Super admin logs into dashboard
2. Sees notification badge with count of unread notifications
3. Clicks notifications icon
4. Views list of password reset requests with:
   - Tenant name
   - User email
   - Request date/time
   - User's message (if provided)
5. Can mark as read or resolve
6. Contacts user directly to verify identity and reset password

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Email enumeration prevention (returns success for non-existent emails)
- No automatic password reset (manual verification required)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Notification priority system
- Metadata storage for investigation

### üîú Future Enhancements
- Notification UI in super admin dashboard
- Email notifications to super admins
- Notification preferences for admins
- Rate limiting on password reset requests
- IP-based tracking and blocking
- OTP-based verification system

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Full Functionality)
1. ‚úÖ Apply database migration (notifications table)
2. üîú Create notifications UI in super admin dashboard
3. üîú Add notification badge/icon in super admin header
4. üîú Create notification management page

### Short Term
1. Email notifications to super admins
2. Notification filtering and search
3. Bulk mark as read functionality
4. Notification settings page

### Long Term
1. In-app notification system with real-time updates
2. Email template system for common responses
3. Automated password reset with email verification
4. SMS/WhatsApp integration for urgent notifications
5. Analytics dashboard for password reset trends

## API Endpoints

### Tenant Auth
- `POST /api/v1/tenant/auth/forgot-password`
  - Body: `{ email, message?, tenantSlug }`
  - Returns: Success confirmation
  - Creates: Notifications for super admins

### Super Admin Dashboard (Existing)
- `GET /api/v1/super-admin/dashboard/stats`
  - Returns: Dashboard statistics including new revenue metrics

### Super Admin Financials (Fixed)
- `POST /api/v1/super-admin/financials/bulk-update-status`
  - Now has try-catch for audit log errors

## Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ Code committed: 39ed038
- ‚úÖ Pushed to main branch
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment triggered
- ‚è≥ Database migration pending (run manually or wait for auto-migration)
- üîú Notification UI pending

## Support

For any issues or questions:
- **Internal:** Check audit logs and notification records
- **User-facing:** Direct users to support@themenugenie.com
- **Emergency:** Check system health and database connectivity

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert 39ed038

# OR drop notifications table if needed
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS notifications CASCADE;

# Push changes
git push origin main
```

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure success:
- Number of password reset requests per week
- Average response time by super admins
- User satisfaction with support response
- Number of resolved vs unresolved requests
- Common patterns in password reset requests
