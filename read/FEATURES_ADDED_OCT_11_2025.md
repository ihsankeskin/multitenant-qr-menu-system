# Features Added - October 11, 2025

## 1. Fixed Root Cause: Prisma Accelerate 5MB Limit

### Problem
The `/api/v1/super-admin/tenants` endpoint was returning 500 errors with the message:
```
"The response size of the query exceeded the maximum of 5MB with 6.39MB"
```

### Root Cause
The Prisma query was fetching ALL fields from the Tenant table, including:
- `logoImage` - Base64 encoded image data
- `coverImage` - Base64 encoded cover image data

These large base64-encoded images caused the response to exceed Prisma Accelerate's 5MB limit.

### Solution
Modified the Prisma query to use explicit `select` instead of fetching all fields:
- ✅ Include only necessary fields for the dashboard
- ❌ Exclude `logoImage` and `coverImage` (large base64 data)
- ✅ Keep `logoUrl` (just the URL string, not the image data)

### Result
- Response size reduced from 6.39MB to well under 5MB
- Dashboard now loads successfully showing all 5 tenants
- API returns 200 status code

## 2. Bulk Payment Status Change Feature

### New Functionality
Added comprehensive bulk action capabilities to the Financials page:

#### UI Enhancements:
1. **Checkbox Column**: Added checkboxes to each payment row
2. **Select All Button**: Toggle selection of all filtered payments
3. **Bulk Actions Bar**: Shows when payments are selected with:
   - Count of selected payments
   - Clear selection button
   - "Change Status" button

4. **Bulk Status Change Modal**:
   - Select new status from dropdown (PAID, PENDING, OVERDUE, CANCELLED, REFUNDED)
   - Shows count of selected payments
   - Confirmation dialog
   - Success/error messaging
   - Auto-refresh after update

#### Backend Implementation:
Created new API endpoint: `/api/v1/super-admin/financials/bulk-update-status`

**Features:**
- Accepts array of payment IDs and new status
- Validates status against allowed values
- Updates multiple payment records in one transaction
- Automatically sets `paidAt` timestamp when status changed to PAID
- Logs action in audit trail for compliance
- Returns count of updated records

**Security:**
- Super admin authentication required
- Authorization token validation
- Input validation for payment IDs and status
- Audit logging for all bulk updates

#### User Flow:
1. User filters payments by status (e.g., "PENDING")
2. User selects specific payments or clicks "Select All"
3. User clicks "Change Status" button
4. Modal appears with status dropdown
5. User selects new status (e.g., "PAID")
6. System updates all selected payments
7. Success message shows count of updated payments
8. Data refreshes automatically

## 3. Revenue Calculation Fix

### Problem
Dashboard was showing $0 revenue for all tenants, even those with paid payments.

### Cause
Revenue calculation was temporarily disabled during debugging of the 5MB Prisma limit issue.

### Solution
Re-enabled revenue calculation in `/api/v1/super-admin/tenants/route.ts`:
```typescript
const revenueResult = await prisma.paymentRecord.aggregate({
  where: {
    tenantId: tenant.id,
    status: 'PAID'
  },
  _sum: { amount: true }
})
revenue = Number(revenueResult._sum?.amount || 0)
```

### Result
- Dashboard now correctly displays actual revenue per tenant
- Only counts payments with status 'PAID'
- Aggregates all paid payment amounts for each tenant
