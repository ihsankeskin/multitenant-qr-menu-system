# Production Fixes Complete - October 6, 2025

## Summary
All reported production issues have been successfully fixed, tested, and deployed to https://themenugenie.com

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Analytics API 500 Error - FIXED
**Problem:** Analytics API was returning 500 Internal Server Error
**Root Cause:** Raw SQL query using PostgreSQL-specific syntax was failing
**Solution:** 
- Initially attempted to fix PostgreSQL syntax in raw SQL query
- Replaced raw SQL with Prisma-based solution using `findMany` + JavaScript `reduce`
- Eliminates database-specific syntax issues
- More maintainable and type-safe

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/v1/tenant/analytics/route.ts`

**Commits:**
- `3e751da` - Fix: PostgreSQL compatibility in analytics raw SQL query
- `28d8b4a` - Fix: Replace raw SQL with Prisma query for analytics daily activity

**Test Results:** ✅ Analytics page loads successfully with all statistics

---

### 2. ✅ Product Prices Display - FIXED
**Problem:** Product prices showing as ج.م0.00 in tenant dashboard
**Root Cause:** 
- Prisma Decimal types not converted to JavaScript Number
- Product interface using deprecated field names (price vs basePrice)

**Solution:**
- Added `Number()` conversion for basePrice and discountPrice in all product APIs
- Updated Product interface in dashboard to use basePrice/discountPrice
- Fixed price display logic in product cards

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/v1/tenant/analytics/route.ts` (priceStats conversion)
- `app/api/v1/tenant/products/route.ts` (list products API)
- `app/api/v1/tenant/products/[id]/route.ts` (single product API)
- `app/tenant/[slug]/dashboard/page.tsx` (Product interface & display)

**Commit:** `72d44bb` - Fix: Multiple issues - Analytics API, Product prices, URLs, Logo

**Test Results:** ✅ Prices display correctly
- Coffee: ج.م30.00
- Tea: ج.م15.00
- EGP currency symbol (ج.م) showing properly

---

### 3. ✅ Tenant Detail URLs - FIXED
**Problem:** URLs in tenant management showing as relative paths, not clickable
**Original:** `/tenant/waseemco/dashboard`
**Solution:** Made URLs full clickable links with complete domain

**Files Modified:**
- `app/super-admin/tenants/[id]/page.tsx`

**Commit:** `72d44bb` - Fix: Multiple issues - Analytics API, Product prices, URLs, Logo

**Test Results:** ✅ URLs now display as clickable full domain links
- Format: `https://themenugenie.com/tenant/{slug}/dashboard`

---

### 4. ✅ Logo and Favicon - ADDED
**Problem:** No branding - logo and favicon missing
**Solution:**
- Created `/public` directory
- Copied logo from Resources/themenugenie logo.jpeg to public/logo.jpg
- Created favicon.ico from logo
- Updated layout.tsx metadata
- Added logo to super admin login page

**Files Created:**
- `public/logo.jpg`
- `public/favicon.ico`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.tsx` (metadata with logo and favicon)
- `app/super-admin/login/page.tsx` (logo display)

**Commit:** `72d44bb` - Fix: Multiple issues - Analytics API, Product prices, URLs, Logo

**Test Results:** ✅ Logo and favicon displaying correctly

---

### 5. ✅ Missing Translation Keys - FIXED
**Problem:** Multiple translation keys showing as raw keys (e.g., tenant.analytics.refreshData)
**Solution:** Added comprehensive translation keys for:
- Analytics page (overview, pricing, inventory, recommendations, alerts)
- Products page (category, unknown, sortOrderLabel, available)
- Dashboard insights

**Files Modified:**
- `locales/en.json` (English translations)
- `locales/ar.json` (Arabic translations already existed)

**Commit:** `489e878` - Add missing translation keys for analytics and products

**Translation Keys Added:**
```
tenant.analytics.refreshData
tenant.analytics.overview.totalCategories
tenant.analytics.overview.totalProducts
tenant.analytics.overview.featuredItems
tenant.analytics.overview.menuHealthScore
tenant.analytics.overview.active

## Data Issues (Not Code Bugs)

### 1. ⚠️ Products Not Assigned to Categories
**Status:** Data issue - products exist but have no category assigned
**Impact:** Dashboard shows "0 categories" and "Category: Unknown" in product listings
**Action Required:** User needs to create categories and assign products via tenant dashboard

### 2. ⚠️ Product Images Not Uploaded
**Status:** Data issue - imageUrl is null in database
**Impact:** Menu page doesn't show product images
**Action Required:** User needs to upload images via tenant dashboard product editor

### 3. ⚠️ Dashboard Statistics Showing 0
**Status:** Related to category assignment issue
**Impact:** Shows "0 categories" even though products exist
**Action Required:** Create categories and organize products

## Technical Details

### Key Changes

#### Decimal to Number Conversion
```typescript
// Before (causes serialization issues)
basePrice: product.basePrice

// After (properly converted)
basePrice: Number(product.basePrice)
```

#### Raw SQL to Prisma Query
```typescript
// Before (PostgreSQL-specific, error-prone)
const dailyActivity = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT...`

// After (database-agnostic, type-safe)
const allActivity = await prisma.auditLog.findMany({...})
const activityByDate = allActivity.reduce((acc, log) => {...})
```

#### Translation Structure
```json
{
  "tenant": {
    "analytics": {
      "overview": {
        "totalCategories": "Total Categories",
        "active": "active"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
